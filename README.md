# C.A.S.P.E.R. ![Build status](https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

## About

Constantly Afloat String Placeholder or CASPER for short,
Is a very minimal tool that holds on to text untill you need it.

This application was originally created by Pankaj Kumar Roy and released under the GNU GPLv3.

## Features

- Floats over everything and holds text, that's it that's all it does.
- And its got that QS tile thing, but mostly it just floats

## How To(s)

- Install and run the latest build from releases
- Add the QS Tile, and long press it
- Grant overlay permission (Android 10+ doesn't allow automatic routing from QS)
- Voila!!
- !! DO NOT BLOCK THE NOTIFICATION FOR THE DAMN APP !!

## The Unintuitive Bits

- Space under Mi Casa, Su Casa next to the close button is supposed to be the drag handle.
- The close button releases focus from the window and closes the keyboard.
- Long pressing the close button instantly closes floating view.
- Copy button copies to clipboard and releases focus.

## Permissions

- Draw over other apps

## Requirements

- Won't work on anything before Oreo
